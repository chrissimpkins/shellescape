SUMMARY OF CHANGES

The Python 3.4.3 function `quote` from the `shlex` module (`shlex.quote()`) was backported in order to provide access
to this function in earlier versions of Python.  The regular expression used to identify unsafe command line strings
was modified to:

_find_unsafe = re.compile(r'[a-zA-Z0-9_^@%+=:,./-]').search

from:

_find_unsafe = re.compile(r'[^\w@%+=:,./-]', re.ASCII).search

in order to remove the re.ASCII flag which is not available in the Python 2.x re module
